# Basics

Some important concepts to remember:

 * Use **snake case**, with all names lower case and "_" separating each word;

 * Instruction end in a ";" char;

 * Function parameters need always data types;

 * Statements and expressions:
   - Statements are instructions that perform an action but do not return any value;
   - Expressions are instructions that perform an action and return a value. They do not end with ";" otherwise no value is returned;

 * Function parameters need always data types;

 * Function may have return values after "->";
